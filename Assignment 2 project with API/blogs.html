              <strong>Use Cases for null:</strong> Null is used to indicate the absence of a value.
               Setting a variable to null is sometimes used to reset or clear a value.
               <br/>
               <strong>Use Cases for undefined: </strong>Represents the absence of an assigned value.
                When trying to access an object property that doesn't exist, the result is undefined.
                Variables that are declared but not assigned a value are automatically initialized with undefined.
                If a function doesn't have an return statement, it returns undefined.

              <strong>Rest API-></strong> REST API, which stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface
               is a way for computer programs to talk to each other over the internet.
               It follows principles like using standard web addresses (URLs) for things, using standard commands like GET for getting data,
                and not keeping track of past interactions. REST makes it easy for different programs to work together in a simple and scalable way.
